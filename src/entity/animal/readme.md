# Animal Needs
The idea here is to formalize the concept of individual needs of a creature, including:
* How quickly does the need arise
* How do you satisfy the need (including a multi-step process, like "find and eat food")
* How much of it do you need, and how do you imbue that quantity onto the thing being consumed, if any
  * ie. Eating requires the thing being ate to have nutrients to be effective.  Eating a rabbit and eating a cow aren't the same amount of sustenance, but I also can't eat a whole cow
*
